In addition, we offer a customizable set that allows the customers to include their own personal touch into the self-care package. Buyers can also choose from our personalized add-ons such as handcrafted bracelets, handcrafted mini-bouquets, playlist cards, and polaroid photos to make their packages extra special (even more so if they wish to gift it to a special someone).
