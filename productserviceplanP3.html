                <p style="color: white">Comfort Crate will initially operate home-based and use social media sites (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), online shopping sites (e.g. Lazada, Shopee), and our own website to display our self-care kits for ease of browsing and ordering as well as to reach a wider audience coverage. Customers will have their packages delivered to their chosen address and they have the option to pay through either cash on delivery (COD) or through E-wallets (e.g. GCash, PayMaya).

                <p style="color: white">Our self-care packages can adapt to the customers' demands as they come in three different specific sets (Snacks, Stationery, and Relaxation Sets) created to serve the various needs of the buyers. In addition, we offer a customizable set that allows the customers to include their own personal touch into the self-care package. Buyers can also choose from our personalized add-ons such as handcrafted bracelets, handcrafted mini-bouquets, playlist cards, and polaroid photos to make their packages extra special (even more so if they wish to gift it to a special someone). Below is a sample of our set packages as well as our personalized add-ons:</p><br>
